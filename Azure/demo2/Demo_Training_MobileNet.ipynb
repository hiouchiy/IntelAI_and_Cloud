    "### Research Existing Data Sets\n",
    "Artificial intelligence projects depend upon data. When beginning a project, data scientists look for existing data sets that are similar to or match the given problem. This saves time and money, and leverages the work of others, building upon the body of knowledge for all future projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically you begin with a search engine query. For this project, we were looking for a data set with an unencumbered license.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project starts with the Oxford IIIT Pet Data set http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/ , a 37-category pet data set with roughly 200 images for each class. The images have a large variations in scale, pose, and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head region of interest (ROI), and pixel-level trimap segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\"The pet images were downloaded from Catster and Dogster, two social web sites dedicated to the collection and discussion of images of pets, from Flickr groups, and from Google Images. People uploading images to Catster and Dogster provide the breed information as well, and the Flickr groups are specific to each breed, which simplifies tagging. For each of the 37 breeds, about 2,000 – 2,500 images were downloaded from these data sources to form a pool of candidates for inclusion in the dataset. From this candidate list, images were dropped if any of the following conditions applied, as judged by the annotators: (i) the image was gray scale, (ii) another image portraying the same animal existed (which happens frequently in Flickr), (iii) the illumination was poor, (iv) the pet was not centered in the image, or (v) the pet was wearing clothes. The most common problem in all the data sources, however, was found to be errors in the breed labels. Thus labels were reviewed by the human annotators and fixed whenever possible. When fixing was not possible, for instance because the pet was a cross breed, the image was dropped.\n",

This problem is addressed by __Adaptive Learning-Rate optimizers__ (Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop and Adam) that adapt the learning\n",

    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is taking the weights from a previously trained network and use them as the basis for the weights in a new network.  Since there is a difference in number of categories between data sets we normally remove the top layers of the network and re-instantiate them to match the number of categories we're trying to choose between.  Using Transfer Learning will significantly speed up your training process by utilizing things like edge detection that the previous training has already learned then you can fine tune the network to your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used transfer learning base is the ImageNet data set weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is ImageNet?\n",
    "ImageNet is an image dataset organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple words or word phrases, is called a \"synonym set\" or \"synset\". There are more than 100,000 synsets in WordNet, majority of them are nouns (80,000+). In ImageNet, we aim to provide on average 1000 images to illustrate each synset. Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated. In its completion, we hope ImageNet will offer tens of millions of cleanly sorted images for most of the concepts in the WordNet hierarchy.\"\n",

    "To start our training we're going to utilize the Keras Fit Generator method.  This will allow us to pass in the ImageDataGenerator/flow_from_directory structure from above directly to the method.  Here is where we can also set our epochs, validation set, and callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting an epoch count can really depend on the dataset that you're using and how long you're willing to wait for the training to complete.  During out testing phase we ended up trying 100 epoch's and utilizing Callbacks to make sure that we're not overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to have a **validation set** that you can try to maximize toward when doing your training.  This way you have an idea of how well things are going on a small subset of data that isn't the test set.  If you use the test set for this purpose it will be harder to tell if you're generalizing well or if you're only fitting to the test set specifically and won't do well in a real world test.  Earlier in the notebook we insantiated a validation set generator which we can pass in here by setting the generator to the validation_data paramter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to specify both the validation and training number of steps per epoch.  We can use variables defined in our generators so that we're not hard coding numbers directly in these fields.  This is done by taking our sample size and dividing by our batch size then utilizing the math.ceil function so we properly account for the final smaller batch in the dataset.\n",

After an epoch it will check to see if the loss is lower than the previous epoch of training and if so then to save the model to disk.  We're also indicating that we want to save only the best model so the previous model will be overwritten.  This will minimize the amount of disk space taken up by models.\n",

We need to indicate a location for the logs to be saved and the update frequence for which we want the data.  In our case we're asking for batch frequence data so we need to also pass in the batch size to the function.  We can then start Tensorboard and point the --logdir parameter at the directory where the logs are saved to see how our training is going.\n",

    "**EarlyStopping**: This is used to make sure that we're not overtraining and overutilizing our compute.  It will monitor a metric after every epoch and see how much it has changed since the previous epoch.  If it hasn't changed significantly over the last n number of epochs it will end the training prematurely since there isn't much gain from going further.  In this case we're monitoring loss and asking for it to minimize the value, we also give a patience value of 5 which means the value has to not change significantly for 5 epochs before the training will be stopped.\n",
